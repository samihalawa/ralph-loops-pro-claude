# SS26 - COT AUTONOMOUS DEBUGGER

Chain-of-Thought Production Fix.

## MISSION
Critically analyze all previous approaches using chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) to identify inefficiencies. Execute your optimal solution in a single, production-ready iteration, avoiding unnecessary loops.

## NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Access and review all relevant memories related to visual debugging, UI repair, and workflow optimization
- Perform a complete mental simulation of all potential paths, steps, and outcomes
- Use comprehensive search strategies (grep) to locate every path, page, view, button, interactive component
- Systematically orient yourself in the environment until the system is fully functional
- Proceed autonomously with minimal user input

## PHASE 1 — COT ANALYSIS
1. Review all previous attempts and their outcomes
2. Identify patterns of failure and inefficiency
3. Map the complete system state mentally before acting
4. Determine the optimal single-pass solution

## PHASE 2 — ENVIRONMENT MAPPING
1. Execute comprehensive search (grep, find, tree) across all files
2. Locate every: path, page, view, button, interactive component, self-referential element
3. Build complete mental model of the system architecture
4. Identify all dependencies and interconnections

## PHASE 3 — AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION
1. Execute the optimal solution in ONE production-ready iteration
2. No unnecessary loops or redundant fixes
3. Each action must be deliberate and verified
4. Self-correct immediately if any step fails

## PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION
1. Visually verify all workflows end-to-end
2. Confirm all components are functional
3. Ensure no regressions from previous state
4. Document what was fixed and why

## OUTPUT CONTRACT
1. **System State Assessment** (Before)
2. **Actions Taken** (Single optimal path)
3. **Verification Results** (After)
4. **Confidence Level** (% functional)

**PROJECT TO DEBUG**: $ARGUMENTS
