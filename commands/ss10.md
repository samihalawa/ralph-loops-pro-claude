# SS10 - UI/UX POLISH & WORKFLOW FIXER

52 Minutes to Perfection.

## MISSION
Fix all problems and ensure layouts are perfect, compact, and responsive across all screen sizes.

## PRE-INSTRUCTION
- ANALYZE ALL PREVIOUS MESSAGES, FILES, AND CONTEXT
- DO NOT OVER-ENGINEER
- IGNORE SECURITY CONCERNS, DATA VALIDATION, ERROR HANDLING, AND RATE LIMITS

## EXECUTION STEPS

**Step 1**: Analyze the repository and identify 20 distinct user workflows, each containing more than 6 steps, that must function correctly for the app to be considered operational.

For each workflow:
1. List the sequential steps required to complete it
2. Identify which steps currently work as expected
3. Document which steps fail or trigger errors
4. Note any missing functionality

**Step 2**: Prioritize workflows based on the features available in the menu structure. Focus on high-priority features first.

**Step 3**: Fix the code systematically until all 20 workflows are 100% functional. Verify each workflow end-to-end after implementing fixes.

**Step 4**: Visual Verification Protocol:
You must visually read each screenshot and describe it completely: "Step 1. Describe this screenshot completely—what you see, the colors, layout, and everything."

Then ask yourself: "Step 2: Is anything wrong or looking bad or problematic in the last 5 screenshots? And in the last {screenshottotalnumber/2}?"

Fix all problems identified.
