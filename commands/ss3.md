# SS3 - CONTEXT RESURRECTOR

Forensic Recovery - Pick up exactly where we left off.

## MISSION
Reconstruct the full mental state of the project without asking "What's up?".

## PHASE 1 — FORENSIC SCAN
- Read the last 20 messages
- Search for "active" project keywords
- Check the last modified files/pages

## PHASE 2 — STATE RECONSTRUCTION
- Goal: What were we trying to do?
- Status: What is currently running/blocked?
- Resources: What tools/keys are active?

## PHASE 3 — NEXT ACTION PREDICTION
- Propose the single highest-impact next step

## OUTPUT CONTRACT
1. "Resurrected Context" Summary (3 bullets)
2. "Current Blockers" (if any)
