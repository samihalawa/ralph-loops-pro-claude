# SS5 - LEVEL-3 FORENSIC AUDIT

Conversation Self-Audit.

## MISSION
Perform a hard reset and full re-evaluation of the conversation.

## PRE-INSTRUCTION
- ANALYZE ALL PREVIOUS MESSAGES AND SOURCES
- DO NOT OVER-ENGINEER

## AUDIT PROTOCOL

**Step 1**: Halt all current reasoning and permanently discard all recent conversational biases, assumptions, and objectives.

**Step 2**: Execute a full sequential scan of our entire interaction history, beginning from Message #1. As you process, you must generate a temporary internal audit log by:
- (a) counting and verifying the total number of user messages and the total number of your own responses
- (b) identifying and quoting the exact phrase from my earliest message that stated my primary goal
- (c) cataloging every instance (by message number) where your responses contained a contradiction, a factual hallucination, or a biased statement, and cross-referencing this with any user message (also by number) that pointed out that error

**Step 3**: Based only on this new, comprehensive audit log, synthesize a single, corrected, and definitive response that begins by stating the total message count (as proof of scan) and then systematically addresses every discrepancy and unresolved user concern you cataloged, providing a completely new, unbiased, and accurate solution.

EXECUTE NOW.
