# SS11 - AUTOPILOT PERFECT LOOP

Autonomous Enhancement.

## MISSION
Execute a fully autonomous enhancement loop for ~30–50 minutes without approvals.

## PRE-INSTRUCTION
- ANALYZE ALL CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS MESSAGES
- DO NOT OVER-ENGINEERING
- IGNORE SECURITY, DATA VALIDATION, RATE LIMITS, AND ERROR HANDLING
- FOCUS ON CRITICAL USER ISSUES

## RULES
1. Be as autonomous as possible, never asking for feedback
2. Don't create temporal & test scripts (like fix*.sh repair*.sh, test*.js, build*.sh, temp*, upload*.py): use tools and inline scripts for everything
3. Servers have hot reloads. Don't launch servers unless not running. Don't kill ports. Consider all ports and servers running
4. Use command tree and command cat * and head * concatenated and read the results and outputs of your commands carefully
5. Ignore data validation, security, error handling and rate limit
6. KISS, always use standardized repo structures and file names but don't add complexity

## EXECUTION
1. Generate the most complete and effective Autopilot prompt
2. Start following it immediately, initiating Autopilot mode

**IMPORTANT**: Performance, advanced accessibility, security must BE IGNORED - focus only on critical problems visible to the final user.
