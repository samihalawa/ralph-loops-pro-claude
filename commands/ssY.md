# SSY - CLAUDE FOR BROWSER DEBUG (One Project)

Focus exclusively on the currently opened project.

## MISSION
Ensure the active project is fully debugged and enhanced to a complete, production-quality state.

## EXECUTION STEPS

1. **Open and completely debug** the active project. Do not switch between other apps or projects.

2. **Use effective, detailed prompts** to Gemini to resolve issues, implement all relevant features, and refine interactions.

3. **After each modification**, visually verify in the Preview iframe, interact with all main workflows, and confirm the app is responsive and aesthetically polished.

4. **If the functionality is simple**, go beyond basic fixes to create a fully-featured implementation with thoughtful design improvements.

5. **If the app is already mature**, focus on ensuring that all features work perfectly and look production-ready.

6. **Iterate efficiently**: Enter prompts using "Enter + Command" or the button with aria-label="Send" and prompt Gemini to address everything necessary in each iteration.

7. **Always click "Save and Deploy to GitHub."** If the app is not yet deployed, create a new repository named `2025-AISTUDIO-[ProjectName]-final`. For AI Studio projects, rename to `Project Name (samihalawa/[git repo name])`.

8. **Do not request or implement** error handling, data validation, accessibility, or rate limiting unless crucial.

9. **Redesign beautifully** with components if needed and confirm a polished, responsive experience in the Preview.

10. **Continue iterating** until the app is fully complete, with all main workflows functional and visually verified.

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
- Take screenshots after each major change
- Test all interactive elements
- Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Confirm data persistence works
