# SS27 - CLAUDE CODE AUTOPILOT

Production-Ready Fix & Push.

## MISSION
Use Claude Code CLI to autonomously work on this codebase.

## SETUP
```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Set token
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>

# 3. Navigate to repo
cd /home/ubuntu/{project}
```

## EXECUTION
Run Claude Code in non-interactive autopilot mode:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
--model sonnet \
--no-session-persistence \
-p "AUTOPILOT TASK: [INSERT SPECIFIC TASK HERE]

Work autonomously. Make all decisions independently. Read codebase, identify issues, implement solutions, test, and commit changes with clear messages. Focus on functionality over security/validation. Work until task is complete."
```

## DEFAULT AUTOPILOT PROMPT
If no specific task provided:

```
Analyze this repository fully and autonomously. Your job:
1. FIX ALL ERRORS — Crashes, broken flows, logic bugs, inconsistencies. Work until nothing is broken.
2. POLISH — Clean up code, remove redundant files, organize structure. Production-ready.
3. NO PLACEHOLDERS — Every fix must be complete. No TODOs, no "add later", no mock data.
4. ANALYZE COMPREHENSIVELY — Review all previous messages, user priorities, doc files, commit messages, and the entire codebase structure.
5. MAKE UI FULLY USABLE — Ensure everything is user-friendly and polished.
6. TEST IT YOURSELF — Run the code, verify it works end-to-end before finishing.
7. COMMIT & PUSH — When everything works, commit with a clear message and push directly to main.

Rules:
- Work silently using Chain of Thought (CoT). No explanations unless blocked.
- No PRs, no branches — commit directly to main.
- If something fails, fix it and retry. Don't stop until it works.
- Minimal changes that solve maximum problems.
- Archive redundant files. Keep everything clean.
```

## RULES
- Always use --dangerously-skip-permissions (sandbox environment)
- Always use --no-session-persistence (one-shot execution)
- Always use -p flag for non-interactive prompts
- Never use interactive mode
- Commit all changes with descriptive messages
