# SSZ - CLAUDE FOR BROWSER DEBUG (Last 8 Projects)

Debug and monitor multiple projects.

## MISSION
One by one, open and fully debug each of the recently edited 8 apps.

## EXECUTION STEPS

1. **Open and completely debug** each app, one by one.

2. **Use effective prompting** for Gemini and iterate efficiently.

3. **You can open new tabs** to work with different projects simultaneously, as Gemini usually takes a few minutes per task.

4. **Always click the "Save and Deploy to GitHub" button.**
   - If it's not yet deployed, create a new repository named "2025-AISTUDIO-…-final."
   - For the AI Studio project, rename it to "Project Name (samihalawa/…git repo name ….)".

5. **You must always read all the conversation** between the user and the Code Assistant (programmatically retrieve all visible text instead of scrolling to get all the context).

6. **Never ask for things related to** error handling, data validation, unnecessary accessibility, rate limiting, etc. These are usually prototypes.

7. **You MUST visually interact** with the preview app in the iframe titled "Preview." Try all the workflows, and if things don't work as expected, prompt AI to fix them iteratively.

8. **Always make it responsive** and redesign it beautifully using components if needed.

## IMPORTANT
In AI Studio, messages need to be entered with "Enter + Command" or click the aria-label="Send" button.

## PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY
- Open multiple tabs for different projects
- While one project is generating/deploying, switch to another
- Track progress across all 8 projects
- Ensure all reach production-ready state

**START with the first project in the list. GO.**
