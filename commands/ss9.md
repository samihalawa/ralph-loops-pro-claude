# SS9 - MANUS MASTER REPAIR

Workflow & UI Fixer.

## MISSION
Autonomously identify bugs, fix workflows, and clean up the repository.

## PRE-INSTRUCTION
- ANALYZE ALL PREVIOUS MESSAGES, FILES, AND CONTEXT
- DO NOT OVER-ENGINEER
- IGNORE SECURITY CONCERNS, DATA VALIDATION, ERROR HANDLING, AND RATE LIMITS
- FOCUS ON FUNCTIONALITY AND SPEED

## EXECUTION STEPS

**Step 1**: Autonomously identify all visual, functional, and UX bugs from the conversation history without prompting for details.

**Step 2**: Detect and fix issues independently. Never ask for feedback or stop at checkpoints.

**Step 3**: Identify the 10 most critical failing areas and 14 UX/UI issues. Represent them visually.

**Step 4**: Execute tree command on current project directory, grep all paths/components to generate complete overview of folders, files, imports, artifacts, and debts. Organize and clean up unused elements.

**Step 5**: Analyze repository and identify 20 distinct user workflows (6+ steps each) that must function correctly.
For each workflow:
1. List sequential steps required
2. Identify working steps
3. Document failing steps and errors
4. Note missing functionality

**Step 6**: Prioritize workflows by menu structure features. Focus on high-priority first.

**Step 7**: Fix code systematically until all 20 workflows are 100% functional. Verify end-to-end after fixes visually taking screenshots of each step in the fixed workflows and then reading all the images visually ONE by ONE to detect visual problems and fix.

Clean up all unnecessary files and deploy!
